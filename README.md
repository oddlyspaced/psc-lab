# 2019 - PSC Lab Solutions
This repository holds code for most of the Problem Solving using Computers lab solutions if not all.

Before opening a pull request, please make sure of the following things -
- Your code must be only in C programming language.
- The program must function properly without any errors.
- You must add your name and github id as a comment on the top of your C program file.
- The file name must start with the problem number, followed by an underscore ( _ ), and then a relevant title. Example - 1_add_numbers.c, 5_fibonacci.c
- Make sure to add your program to the specific lab directories. If your program does not correspond to any lab questions then make sure to add it to the misc folder, while adding the question statement as a comment in it.
- Make sure to only add the .c program file and not anything else. Pull requests containing files like a.out, a.exe or other garbage won't be accepted.
_Any pull request which does not follow the above points will not be accepted._
